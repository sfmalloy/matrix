# Matrix
Matrix class with operations for C++

### Requirements
- g++
- make

### Compiling and running
Currently there is no driver, but if you make your own feel free to use the included Makefile. If you want the Makefile to work out of the box be sure you are have g++ installed as well as a file called driver.cpp. Eventually, I will make a driver for all to use that will act as sort of an "interpreter".
