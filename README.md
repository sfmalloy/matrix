# Matrix
Matrix class with operations for C++.

### Requirements
- g++
- make

### Compiling and running
`matrix.hpp` is the one and only header that you need to start making programs with different matrix operations. A proof-of-concept interpreter is implemented in `main.cpp`, and is mostly used to showcase the functionality of the `matrix.hpp` header.
