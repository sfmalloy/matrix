# Matrix
Matrix class with operations for C++

### Requirements
- g++
- make

### Compiling and running
Interpreter (main.cpp) in planning stages.

### Using matrix.hpp
You can choose to either use main.cpp to do matrix operations, or use matrix.hpp in your own C++ programs. It is a single header, just include it and you're set. Documentation within matrix.hpp coming later.
