# Matrix
Matrix class with operations for C++

### Requirements
- g++
- make

### Compiling and running
`main.cpp` interpreter is proof of concept for how `matrix.hpp` can be used. Will eventually be reworked to be more robust for general matrix algebra use.

### Using `matrix.hpp`
You can choose to either use `main.cpp` to do matrix operations, or use matrix.hpp in your own C++ programs. It is a single header, just include it and you're set. Documentation within matrix.hpp coming later.

### TODO
- complete rework of `main.cpp`
- create `vector.hpp`
- cleanup and comment `matrix.hpp`
